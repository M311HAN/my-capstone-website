## Description

Capstone Personal Site is a four-page website where I share personal information, hobbies, favourite recipes, and a saved items feature. The website is primarily designed for those who share similar interests and would like to know more about me, my childhood and my favourite recipes. It also offers a feature for users to save articles, images, links, and information for viewing at a later time.

## Usage

The Capstone Personal Site can be used to learn more about me and my favourite recipes. It provides a platform where users can save articles, images, links, or any other information they find interesting. Users can interact with the website by liking posts and leaving comments on the pages. They can also subscribe to a newsletter for receiving more recipes.

For example, to save an article, simply click on the save button on any article and it will be moved to the 'Saved Items' page. This page can be viewed later to recall saved articles.
