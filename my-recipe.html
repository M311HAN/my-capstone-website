	<ol>
		<li>160 g of the flour should be combined with the yeast, sugar, and water to make a moist dough. For 1-2 hours, cover and allow to double in size.</li>
		<li>Salt, olive oil, and the remaining flour should all be added. Knead the dough on medium to high speed in a kitchen appliance until it is elastic and smooth. It often takes 5 to 10 minutes, although this can vary greatly. Ensure that the temperature of your dough doesn't rise over that of your body; if it does, cover it and store it in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes before continuing. The dough is prepared when it can be stretched between your fingers almost transparently without breaking. Cover and wait for about an hour for the size to double.</li>
		<li>Turn the heat all the way up in your oven (mine goes to 300 C/570 F), then place a pizza stone or baking stone high up. Depending on the material, pizza stones and baking stones might take anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes to warm up. Just preheat the oven to its highest setting if you don't have one.</li>
		<li>After the dough has doubled in size, tip onto a floured surface. Cut into 6‚Äì8 pieces of similar sizes. Stretch the edges of each piece repeatedly towards the centre until the surface is firm and smooth, then roll each piece into a ball. Let the balls to rise one last time while being covered and placed seam-side down, for 15-20 minutes.</li>
		<li>Create the topping in the meanwhile. The tomato's wet core should be thrown away. Mix the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and flat-leaf parsley after being chopped to a very fine consistency. For this, I utilise a kitchen appliance. Drain some of the liquid if the mixture appears to be extremely wet. Mixture, minced meat, red pepper paste, tomato paste, salt, and pepper should all be placed in a bowl with the mixture.</li>
		<li>Each piece of dough is rolled out into a very thin disc. Put it on a pizza peel covered in flour. If you find it more convenient, you could also put it on baking parchment. Apply a thin layer of the topping mixture with your fingertips to cover the entire flatbread pretty evenly. If there are some areas with very little topping, don't be concerned. To expect this from Lahmacun!</li>
		<li>Depending on the heat of your oven and whether you're using a pizza stone or a baking stone, bake one or two lahmacun at a time until the edges are crispy and brown, around 3 to 8 minutes. If you don't have one, bake for 2-4 minutes on a standard baking sheet at the bottom of the oven. After that, place it to the top of the oven for the final 2-3 minutes of cooking.</li>
		<li>Serve right away with your preferred dipping sauces.</li>
